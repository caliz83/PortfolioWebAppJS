We are starting to accumulate these great projects and want to show case them in a portfolio web app for your future employers to see. In this Sprint you will research what a portfolio web app should contain for a web developer and create your own unique portfolio web app. We will be doing this in React, Chakra UI or Bootstrap , and deploying it with Azure and using ASP.NET Core for our API, 

Create front end with React using Vite
Use Chakra UI or Bootstrap
You are welcome to use any third party libraries you see fit
Site must have a landing page, an about me page, and a contact me page with a form so people can send you their information, A page were you can click on your projects and show case them..
Add your unique styling and make it your own.
